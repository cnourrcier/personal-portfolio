                        <h4>Software Developer
                            <br /> based in New Jersey, USA üìç

                        <p>I have a strong love and endless curiosity for designing and building things. In my experience, undertanding something on a fundamental level allows me to discover new and better ways to put the pieces back together. A core part of who I am, both as a software engineer and as an individual, is the desire to continuously learn and grow. I am self-driven and quickly become invested in projects, diving deep into problems to find the best solution.
